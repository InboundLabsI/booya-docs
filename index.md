## 1. Add Booya to your website

**NOTE**: To see Code Snippets at [go.booya.io](https://go.booya.io), you need to enable the "Show Code Snippets" toggle.

### 1.1 Enable Booya

**IMPORTANT:** This snippet is already included in BRiX templates so it doesn't need to be added for BriX users.

Copy the code snippet from "Code Snippet: Enable Booya" from the Integration page (enable the "Show Code Snippets" toggle to see this section) and add it to your website or portal.

![Image](images/snippet_enable_booya.png)

**NOTE:** Preferably, this should be added in the head area of all your pages. Follow this [guide for HubSpot websites](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cos-general/how-can-i-add-code-snippets-to-the-head-and-footer-html-of-my-pages) for additional help.

### 1.2 Add Authentication UI to a section, page or module

Copy the code snippet from "Code Snippet: Render Authentication UI" from the Integration page (enable the "Show Code Snippets" toggle to see this section) and add it to the relevant section, page or module of your website.

![Image](images/snippet_render_auth_ui.png)

This code snippet will add an authentication widget with sign in, sign up and recover password forms with links that allow the user to switch between different forms.

![Image](images/screenshot_auth_widget.png)

NOTE: For version 0.2.7 and higher of the Booya UI Library, changes made to the Registration form in HubSpot are synchronized with this authentication widget.

### 1.3 Redirect user to a different page after sign in or logout

Set the "Member URL" and "Guest URL" in the Admin Dashboard under "Authentication Settings". Users will be redirected to the "Member URL" after sign in and to the "Guest URL" after logout.

![Image](images/screenshot_member_guest_url.png)

For more advanced redirect behaviour on sign in based on contact properties on sign in, check the "Enable Advanced Member URL Configuration" and add an option for each redirect based on a contact property value.

![Image](images/screenshot_advance_member_config.png)

**NOTE:** With "Member URL", "Guest URL" and optionally "Advanced Member URL Configuration" configuration setup
- Users will be redirected to the "Member URL" or a matching url in "Advanced Member URL Configuration" after signing in
- Users will be redirected to "Guest URL" on logging out
- Logged in users landing on the "Guest URL" will be redirected to the "Member URL" or a matching url in "Advanced Member URL Configuration"
- Logged out users landing on "Member URL" or any url in the "Advanced Member URL Configuration" will be redirected to the "Guest URL"

**NOTE:** This requires version 0.2.21 or higher of the Booya UI Library.

### 1.4 Add a user widget after authentication and remove it on logout

**IMPORTANT:** For BRiX users, this functionality is included in the "Authentication" module, so the snippets below should only be for more advanced customization of the default authentication behaviour.

The user widget shows the user's avatar and name and includes options to "Edit Profile" and "Sign Out" on hover/focus.

![Image](images/screenshot_user_widget.png)

**HTML:**
```HTML
<!-- Add a wrapper for the user widget to the page HTML -->
<div id="booya-user-wrapper"></div>

```

**JavaScript:**
```JavaScript
booya.ready(function () {
  // Listen for sign in event
  booya.on(booya.events.IDENTIFY_SUCCESS, function (e) {
    // Add the user widget
    booya.widgets.renderUserWidget("#booya-user-wrapper");
  });

  // Listen for logout event
  booya.on(booya.events.LOGOUT_SUCCESS, function (e) {
    // Remove user widget
    // This is necessary if you don't redirect user away from the page
    $("#booya-user-wrapper").html("");
  });
});
```

### 1.5 Edit Registration/ Sign Up and Profile Forms

Changes made to the HubSpot forms set as **"HubSpot Registration Form ID"** and **"HubSpot Profile Form ID"** in [go.booya.io](https://go.booya.io) will be reflected in the Sign Up and Edit Profile forms on your website. 

These HubSpot forms are automatically created by Booya and named **"Booya: Registration Form"** and **"Booya: Profile Form"** by default, however, they can be changed to other HubSpot forms in [go.booya.io](https://go.booya.io).

**IMPORTANT:**
- Both HubSpot forms should include an email field otherwise submissions from your website will fail because submissions need to be associated with a contact.
- The registration form in HubSpot shouldn't include a password field, this field is automatically added by Booya and passwords are **NOT** stored in HubSpot. Booya stores passwords as [Bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) hashes in a MongoDB database for email authentication.
- While the profile form in HubSpot must include an email, this field will not be shown on your website because it's autofilled by Booya when submitting to HubSpot.
- This requires version 0.2.7 or higher of the Booya UI Library.

### 1.6 Protecting content in HubL

- Create a template partial at the path "InboundLabs/Booya v2/macros/auth.html"

- Copy the HubL code snippet from "Code Snippet: HubL Macro" from the Integration page (enable the "Show Code Snippets" toggle to see this section) into it.

![Image](images/snippet_hubl_macro.png)

- You can then import "InboundLabs/Booya v2/macros/auth.html" as a macro in your modules and templates and conditionally show content only if "is_authed" is true as shown below
